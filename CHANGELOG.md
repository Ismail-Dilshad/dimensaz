# Changelog

## 3.1.0: Agent foundation (English default, Kurdish first-class)

- **Agent:** new `agent/` with manifest, persona (senior motion designer and editor),
  policies, three mode playbooks (script to motion, reference match, footage edit),
  briefing questions (at most five, only what is missing), a 69-tool registry
  (8 planned), a knowledge index with source and license per entry, ten golden
  evals and a rubric. Knowledge updates are proposals that wait for approval.
- **Languages:** English is the default. Language is detected from the script
  (Kurdish letters select Sorani, Persian letters Persian, other Arabic script
  Arabic, otherwise English). `config/locales.json` maps each language to its
  direction and fonts; `locales/` holds agent strings (non-English drafts need
  native review).
- **Fonts:** Kurdish uses only the existing Kurdish fonts; other languages use six
  bundled OFL fonts chosen by style. The Latin fallback is bundled, so renders no
  longer depend on Windows or Linux system fonts. No hardcoded font in instructions.
- **Editor:** `packages/editor` edits footage from an edit decision list: trim,
  split, cut, concat, crop, reframe, zoom, speed, fades, gain, two-pass loudness,
  resize and right-to-left caption burn-in. Never modifies inputs or overwrites outputs.
- **Automatic motion:** on by default from `brand/profile.json`; a request can set
  `autoMotion: false`.
- **Setup:** `reelwright` command, `reelwright init`, a fuller `doctor`, and the
  `hello-en` / `hello-ckb` examples.
- **Open source:** README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, templates, CI,
  THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES; license decision pending (`LICENSE.todo.md`).
- **Fixes:** 29 broken symlinked PNGs replaced with real files; sound index paths
  made relative; one skill source of truth with a synced Claude Code copy.
- Saved projects keep their language, fonts and look. See `docs/MIGRATION.md`.

## Portable motion production skill

- Consolidated the default create, review, resume and export workflow into
  `SKILL.md`. The former production skill forwards to it.
- Moved the layered scene and scene packet guides from `output/` to
  `references/` and updated the storyboard command, skills and local indexes.
- Removed three verified byte-identical duplicates: the root Pendulum fit JSON,
  the archived green-brand video and the archived Raycast video. Removed the
  duplicate archive's guide and empty folders. The canonical copies remain.
- Retired Citron Clay, Violet Cutout and new clay preset creation. New reference
  jobs require 3D object records and still require provenance and visual review.
  Saved jobs and render dependencies retain their original style data.
- Added a short-form editing guide and a searchable local memory file. The
  root skill uses both when planning new work.

The collection catalog and visual review now live under `references/`.
Saved evidence paths using the former catalog location still resolve to the
same checksummed anchors. The shared Claude Code and Cursor entry point lives
under `.claude/skills/`. Historical handoffs, saved media and prior exports
were preserved.
